# Summary
A script to remove AD users from AD groups, based on given memberships.  

# Behavior
- Accepts a CSV file with one row for each user-in-group membership which should be removed. See documentation of `-InputCsv` parameter.
- Validates that all given AD objects and memberships exist.
- Performs the membership removals.
- Outputs results to new CSV.

# Requirements
- Requires RSAT to be installed.
- Must be run as a user account with permissions to modify the relevant AD groups and with access to the MemberOf property of the relevant AD users.
- Developed and tested on PowerShell v7.1.

# Usage
1. Download `Remove-AdGroupMemberships.psm1` to `$HOME\Documents\WindowsPowerShell\Modules\Remove-AdGroupMemberships\Remove-AdGroupMemberships.psm1`.
2. Run it using the examples and documentation provided below, including the `-TestRun` switch.
3. Review the output to confirm that the changes match your expectations.
4. Run it again without the `-TestRun` switch.

# Example
It's recommended to capture the output in a variable, like so:
```powershell
$result = Remove-AdGroupMemberships ...
```

### Common usage for EngrIT
```powershell
$result = Remove-AdGroupMemberships -TestRun -InputCsv "c:\input.csv" -OutputCsv ":ENGRIT:" -Log ":ENGRIT:"
```

# Parameters

### -TestRun
Optional switch.  
If specified, the script will skip the step where it actually modifies AD groups. Everything else (i.e. the data gathering, munging, logging, and output) will happen as normal.  

### -ConfirmEach
Optional switch.  
If specified, the script will prompt for confirmation before each individual membership removal.  
If not specified, no prompts will be given.  

### -InputCsv \<string\>
Required string.  
The full path to a properly-formatted CSV file.  
Formatting requirements:  
  - Columns named `User` and `Group` are required (by default). Input column names can be customized using the `-InputUserColumn` and `-InputGroupColumn` parameters.
  - Each row represents a single membership of a user in a group.
  - Cells should just contain the regular name of the user or group.
  - Additional columns may be present and will be ignored.  
  - Columns may be in any order.  

`example-input1.csv` shows an example of the minimum requirements.  
`example-input2.csv` shows an example of the minimum requirements with some extraneous data in columns which will be ignored.  

### -InputUserColumn \<string\>

Required string.  
The full path of a file to export results to, in CSV format.  
If `:TS:` is given as part of the string, it will be replaced by a timestamp of when the script was started, with a format specified by `-LogFileTimestampFormat`.  
Specify `:ENGRIT:` to use a default path (i.e. `c:\engrit\logs\Remove-AdGroupMemberships_<timestamp>.csv`).

### -Log \<string\>
Optional string.  
The full path of a file to log to.  
If omitted, no log will be created.  
If `:TS:` is given as part of the string, it will be replaced by a timestamp of when the script was started, with a format specified by `-LogFileTimestampFormat`.  
Specify `:ENGRIT:` to use a default path (i.e. `c:\engrit\logs\Remove-AdGroupMemberships_<timestamp>.log`).
