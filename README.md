# THIS SCRIPT IS A WORK IN PROGRESS

# Summary
A script to remove AD users from AD groups, based on a given memberships.  

# Behavior
Accepts a CSV file with one row for each user-in-group membership which should be removed. Checks that all objects are valid and performs the membership removals.  

# Requirements
- Requires RSAT to be installed.
- Must be run as a user account with permissions to modify the relevant AD groups.
- Developed and tested on PowerShell v7.1.

# Usage
1. Download `Remove-AdGroupMemberships.psm1` to `$HOME\Documents\WindowsPowerShell\Modules\Remove-AdGroupMemberships\Remove-AdGroupMemberships.psm1`.
2. Run it using the examples and documentation provided below, including the `-TestRun` switch.
3. Review the output to confirm that the changes match your expectations.
4. Run it again without the `-TestRun` switch.

# Example
It's recommended to capture the output in a variable, like so:
```powershell
$result = Remove-AdGroupMemberships -TestRun -InputCsv "c:\input.csv" -OutputCsv "c:\output.csv"
```

### Common usage for EngrIT
```powershell
$result = Remove-AdGroupMemberships -TestRun -InputCsv "c:\input.csv" -OutputCsv ":ENGRIT:" -Log ":ENGRIT:"
```

# Parameters

### -TestRun
Optional switch.
